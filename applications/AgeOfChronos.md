## 8. Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

- **Questions and Concerns:** We are particularly interested in feedback regarding our approach to NFT integration and interactions within a blockchain environment. We could have a modular and scalable game over time, create different environments and perhaps designed in honor of friendly teams who want to collaborate with us.
We will make the game more and more compelling although our idea, as mentioned at the beginning, is certainly not to compete with existing AAA games on web2.
We have all the resources and experience to do this, we firmly believe in the potential of our team.
Age Of Chronos will become a gathering place for users from different parachains and can also be used to ensure the fairness and inclusiveness of community airdrops.
