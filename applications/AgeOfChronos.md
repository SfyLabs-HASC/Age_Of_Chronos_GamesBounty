## Game Project Overview :page_facing_up:

# Game Project Application Form

## 1. Pitch the Game

### Please describe the game in a short pitch.
"Age of Chronos" is an immersive RPG that integrates NFT 2.0 technology to create a dynamic and player-driven universe. Set in a world where time is both a resource and a currency, players embark on time-travel adventures to change outcomes and make history. Every choice impacts the player's legacy and has real-world value, as characters and items are unique NFTs that can be traded on the Polkadot network.

### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)
Discover (Explore time periods) -> Encounter (Engage in strategic battles) -> Acquire (Collect unique NFTs 2.0) -> Upgrade (Enhance characters and items)

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?
While sharing some similarities with games like "Evrloot" in terms of blockchain technology, "Age of Chronos" uniquely combines RPG mechanics with blockchain technology, allowing for real ownership of game assets as NFTs. Unlike traditional games where in-game assets remain within the game's ecosystem, our assets can be used across different games and platforms within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Do you have a Game Design Document (GDD) for your project?
- **No,** currently, we do not have a formal GDD available for review. Our development efforts have been focused on prototyping and refining core game mechanics, including the integration of NFTs.

## 2. Game Dev Experience

### Have you built games prior to this bounty request?
- **Yes,** We have successfully developed and launched the first playable dungeon in "Age of Chronos", demonstrating our capabilities in game design and blockchain integration. This dungeon, along with mintable NFTs, is currently accessible on our website for testing and initial public engagement.

### Do any of the previously mentioned games have a Web3 component?
- **No,** previous games did not incorporate Web3 technology. "Age of Chronos" is our first venture into integrating blockchain technology to enhance gameplay and asset management.

### Do you have experience in working with game engines, such as Unity & Unreal?
- **Yes,** our development team is proficient in using Unity, which is our chosen engine for "Age of Chronos" due to its flexibility and support for blockchain integration. Examples of our work with Unity can be found here:

## 3. Technical Expertise

### How much of your game logic do you intend to build on the blockchain?
- [ ] None, I just want a token.
- [ ] Only the Game Assets/NFTs should remain on-chain.
- [X] Some mechanics will need to be on-chain.
- [ ] This should be a fully on-chain game.
- [ ] Other:

### Do you have any expertise in Blockchain Development?
- [ ] No, none at all.
- [ ] I know how the Blockchain works, but never developed anything in crypto.
- [X] I have EVM / SmartContract experience.
- [ ] I have only used SDK for my games on other platforms.
- [ ] I know Rust & Substrate and can create basic runtime code.
- [ ] Other:

### Would you like a technical team from Polkadot Play, to help you identify the technical requirements?
- **No,** we do not require assistance with identifying technical requirements at this stage. However, we may seek technical support in the future as we expand and refine our game features. Our team is proficient in blockchain integration and game development, specifically on the Moonbeam network using EVM. We have successfully implemented on-chain mechanics, such as character upgrades through ERC7508, and the creation of composable NFTs that enhance gameplay.
